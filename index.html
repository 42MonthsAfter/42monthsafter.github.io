						<h2>What exactly is PvPvE anyway?</h2>
						<p>Basically everything is trying to kill you.</p>
					</header>
						<p>Bears, wolves, the cold, the water... Everything is trying to kill you, and then there are other survivors who may fancy murder to conversation.  Loot the PvP zones for high tier loot and gear, but look over your shoulder from time to time.</p>
						<p>Dynamic gameplay like air drops and King of the Hills bring survivors together to get speciality loot and supplies. Be careful though, like we said, not everyone is friendly. Just because you aren't in a PvP zone doesn't mean you are safe. This is the world today.</p>

							<p>Deer Isle's biggest export is refer, so farming it can set you up. Hunting and fishing while keeping you fed can also get you paid.</p>
							<p>Higher risk = higher return if you have the nerve to loot the PvP zones and sell your top tier loot to this shady AF character who runs the black market trader in Area 42.</p>

						<p>Some folks are friendly and will lend a hand. Others, not so much.</p>
					</header>
						<p>There are special PvP locations marked on your map where literally anything goes. They just happen to be the home of the highest tier loot on Deer Isle. If you're brave enough, bring a buddy to watch your back.</p>
						<p>Just because you're not in a PvP zone doesn't mean you're safe. Murder happens all the time, but anywhere outside of a PvP zone will result in an instant bounty on the killer's head for 48 IRL hours. Think twice before pulling that trigger.</p>
